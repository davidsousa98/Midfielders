# Studying midfielders from the top 5 Leagues
  The project proposal is divided into two levels. Firstly, taking into consideration the characteristics and statistics of the midfielders throughout the season, the players were grouped based on their roles. As a result, the technical staff will be more informed and aware of the potentially most impactful characteristics of the opposing team and therefore improve their decisions.

  Secondly, after the formation of the groups, a predictive model was applied in order to assign new players to the groups already established. This approach is useful in the sense that, for instance during the winter transfer window, new players arrive at the league and the model is capable of predicting the role of the unknown player according to his mid-season characteristics.

  The data used throughout the entire project concern to the matches of the top 5 leagues during the season 2018/19 as well as the participating players.
